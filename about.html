      <p  class="lead-paragraph">This website explores the Futurist Artist Manifesto, authored by  Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, in a non-linear typographical interpretation.  <a href="http://instructian.com/">Ian Pollock</a>, design professor at University of San Francisco, assigned this project to sharpen our web-font and css animation skills. I created wireframes, mock-ups, and coded the website using jQuery, Bootstrap, and Typekit. The final deliverables were presented and critiqued in my web design class during the fall of 2013. </p>

      <p>I am fascinated with motion and how it can embellish subtle interactions in a design system. While researching for this project, I searched for a manifesto that could be translated into typographic form with moving imagery. Several artist movements and declarations addressed revolutionary movement and change, but the Futurist Manifesto presented an array of possibilities that could be translated into a web browser. The essence and themes of the Futurist manifesto lends itself to aggressive motion, disarray, and destruction. All of these words, in a sense, can be related to experimental design and how a designer can explore new (typographic) compositions.</p>

      <p>The web, a medium that is fundamentally built on standards and rules, is only able to display a turbulent impression of motion—breaking visual guidelines still requires obedience to web standards. The biggest challenge in this assignment was making the site responsive and cross-browser compatible while maintaining predictable and consistent visual identity. While designing I approached this project with four major steps or guidelines.</p>
      <hr>
      <ol style="padding-left:25px"> 
        <li>Researching, gathering, and organizing content</li>
        <li>Sketching ideas and layout on paper and Illustrator</li>
        <li>Using a third-party framework (Bootstrap 3) to minimize development time</li>
        <li>Making a "skeleton template" and filling in content afterwards</li>
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <p>While I was sketching, I thought about the user and how they might want to navigate through the site. What would encourage interaction? How might they want to navigate through the different pages? Are all of the pages accessible? How will this look on a wide range of devices? These considerations helped refine my design choices. The navigation on the left side of the page allows the user to focus on the pages content without distracting and directing them to the next page or step of the manifesto. The site isn't necessarily meant to viewed in a linear fashion&#8212;I intended for the pages to be independent of each other for user exploration and observation.</p>

      <p>
        While designing this site, I learned valuable lessons and new methodologies for project management and rapid prototyping. Time constraints in this project forced me to focus on setting (and meeting) deadlines while balancing my academic workload in other classes...oh yeah, and my social life. The Giants didn’t even make the playoffs this year, so at least my post-season fanatics were kept at bay (<a href="http://mattwujek.com/img/giants-parade.jpg">unlike like last year</a>).
